# Expo Image Component Local Image Loading Issue

This repository demonstrates a common yet frustrating issue when using Expo's Image component to load local images.  The problem lies in the lack of clear error messages when the image fails to load.  This makes debugging significantly more difficult than it should be.

The `bug.js` file contains code that reproduces the error. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution demonstrating how to resolve this issue by implementing robust error handling and path verification.  

## Reproducing the Error

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app (e.g., `expo start`).
4. Observe the failure to load the image.  Expo's error messages may be generic.

## Solution

The solution implemented in `bugSolution.js` involves the following:

- **Explicit Path Verification**: Before attempting to load the image, verify that the file exists at the specified path.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Implement `try...catch` blocks to handle potential errors during image loading, providing more informative error messages.

This approach provides more effective debugging capabilities by offering precise information regarding the failure point.
